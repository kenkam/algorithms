Algorithms - A project for learning algorithms 
==============================================

Algorithms is a project for learning algorithms. It is initially implemented in C++, but may include other languages in the future. 

It is very primitive at the moment and there are things such as testing and benchmarking that would add to this project. However, there is enough code to start implementing other algorithms.

Running
-------

As simple as:

    make
    ./algorithms
